// First of all, forget every naming convention wowdev.wiki use, it's extremely confusing.
// A Map (e.g. Eastern Kingdoms) consists of 64x64 Chunks which may or may not be used.
// A Chunk consists of 16x16 Cells which are all being used.
// A Cell consists of two interlapping grids. There is the 9*9 OUTER grid and the 8*8 INNER grid.
